						<p class="info"> By signing this attestation I certify that:</p>
						

						<p class="info"> All of the information I provided is true and complete to the best of my knowledge. Upon request, I agree to provide to the U.S. Department of Education information that is reasonably available to me that will verify the accuracy of my completed attestation.
						<br><br>
						I agree to provide, upon request, testimony, a sworn statement, or other documentation reasonably available to me that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the U.S. Department of Education or its designee that I meet the qualifications for borrower defense.
						<br><br>

						I certify that I received proceeds of a federal loan, in whole or in part, to attend the school/campus identified in Section II (above).
						<br><br>

						I understand that if my application is approved and some or all of my loans are forgiven, I am assigning to the U.S.  Department of Education any legal claim I have against the school for those forgiven loans. By assigning my claims, I am effectively transferring my interests in any claim that I could make against the school relating to the forgiven loans (including the ability to file a lawsuit over those forgiven loans and any money ultimately recovered in compensation for those forgiven loans in court or other legal proceedings) to the U.S. Department of Education. I am not assigning any claims I may have against the school for any other form of relief—including injunctive relief or damages related to private loans, tuition paid out-of-pocket, unforgiven loans, or other losses.
						<br><br>

						I understand that the U.S. Department of Education has the authority to verify information reported on this application with other federal or state agencies or other entities. I authorize the U.S. Department of Education, along with its agents and contractors, to contact me regarding this request at the phone number above using automated dialing equipment or artificial or prerecorded voice or text messages.
						<br><br>

						I understand that any rights and obligations with regard to borrower defense to repayment are subject to the provisions currently in effect under Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
						<br><br>

						I understand that if I purposely provided false or misleading information on this application, I may be subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. § 1001, including fines.  I understand that I may be asked to confirm the truthfulness of the statements in this application to the best of my knowledge under penalty of perjury.
