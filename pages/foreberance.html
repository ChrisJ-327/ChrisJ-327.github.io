					Section 6: Forbearance / Stopped Collections
				</div>

				<p class="info">

If you are not in default on your federal student loans, you may request to have them placed into forbearance status while your application is under review. <strong>Forbearance means that you do not have to make loan payments and your loans will not go into default. </strong> Your servicer will notify you when your loans have been placed into forbearance status. <br><br>

If your federal student loans are in default, you may request to have debt collection on your loan stopped (“stopped collections status”).  <strong>Stopped Collections means that the federal government or debt collection companies will stop attempting to collect on the loans, including by not withholding money from your wages or income tax refunds. </strong>  <br><br>

Please see the "<a href="../faq.html" target="_blank">Common Questions and Answers Regarding Forbearance/Stopped Collections</a>” for more information. <br><br>

Interest will continue to accumulate on all federal loans regardless of what status they are in. <strong>If your application for borrower defense is denied, or partially approved, the total amount you owe on those loans may be higher. </strong><br><br>

Forbearance or Stopped Collections status will continue until the review of your application is completed. 

PLEASE NOTE: You do not have to place your loans in forbearance or stopped collections to apply for borrower defense relief.  <br><br>
